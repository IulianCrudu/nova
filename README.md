# Nova

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/kaviarjs/nova.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kaviarjs/nova)

_Nova_ is the fetching layer on top of MongoDB Node Driver, which allows SQL-comparable speeds for retrieving relational data. [Read the whole history here](./docs/story.md)

GraphQL is treated as a first-class citizen, by offering ability to transform the GraphQL query into a Nova query. **You do not have to use GraphQL to use this library**

The incredible speed boost is possible thanks to the technology called Hypernova, created by [Theodor Diaconu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtheodor/) in 2016 for Meteor. [Read more about it.](./docs/hypernova.md)

## What it solves

- It makes it bearable to use MongoDB as a relational database
- Speeds surpassing SQL in various scenarios.
- Works with GraphQL to avoid over-fetching

## Installation

```
npm i -S @kaviar/nova
```

## [Documentation](docs/index.md)

This provides a learning curve for **Nova** and it explains all the features.

## Sample

```js
import { query, manyToOne } from "@kaviar/nova";

async function test() {
  const Post = await db.createCollection("Post");
  const Comments = await db.createCollection("Comments");

  manyToOne(Comments, Post, {
    // will automatically read from postId inside Comments
    linkName: "post",
    inversedLinkName: "comments",
  }); // also available manyToMany and manyToOne

  query(Post, {
    $: {
      filters: {
        isApproved: true
      }
    }
    title: 1,
    comments: {
      name: 1
    }
  })
}
```

## [GraphQL](./docs/index.md)

```js
import { query } from "@kaviar/nova";

const Query = {
  // Automatically fetches everything in the minimum amount of queries
  users(_, args, ctx, info) {
    // It passes arguments automatically
    return query.graphql(Posts, info).fetch();
  },
};
```
